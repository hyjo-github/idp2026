class Worker(QRunnable):
    """
    Class for creating worker threads that can emit progress signals.
    Additionally, the instances of the class emit finished, result,
    or error signals in response to runner function's behaviour.

    The runner function may at any point emit a progress signal. The
    progress signal is expected to pass an integer in 0-100 range. The runner
    function signature must include named argument "progress_callback".

    If the runner finishes successfully, a result signal is emitted.
    The result signal will pass the return value of the runner function,
    and may be an arbitrary object.

    If the runner function raises an exception, a traceback is printed,
    and an error signal is emitted. The exception data is passed in the
    emitted error signal.

    After the runner function has exited, regardless of success or failure,
    a finished signal is emitted. The finished signal will pass no data.
